# UTMB points race info puller
- so you can take all the UTMB points races with their relevant info and put it into an easy to manipulate .csv

I wanted to do this so I could plan out potential races in 2021 that are likely to be points races and build my calendar so that I can have enough points to do the CCC.


Current version (as of 2020-09-16) is able to pull up the page and enter search criteria then pull up the first race name and url to the race website.

Next steps are to finish getting the info for an entire race and distances into independent rows then iterate through all races on the page to give a full list.
